Hey! I'm [Ozan](about-me/index.qmd), a data scientist/engineer/detective with a background in industrial engineering. I currently work as a data analytics consultant at [OneMagnify](https://onemagnify.com). Sometimes, I also teach at my alma mater, [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/). 

On this website, you'll find my [resume](resume/index.qmd), [projects](projects/index.qmd), and [blog](blog/index.qmd), along with a [teaching](teaching/index.qmd) section covering courses I've taught (and hopefully some workshops & talks in the future). I'm also really interested in the tools others use, especially in the data realm. You can see mine at [tech stack](tech-stack/index.qmd), and I'd love to learn about yours.
